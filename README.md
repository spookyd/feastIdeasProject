## Steps to Run the App

## Focus Areas: 
What specific areas of the project did you prioritize? Why did you choose to focus on these areas?

## Time Spent: 
Approximately how long did you spend working on this project? How did you allocate your time?

## Trade-offs and Decisions: 

### Compiler Enforced Boundaries

Typically I would have the architecture layers be located within the Swift Packages to enforce architecture boundaries.
For the sake of time I am skipping this particular step as it does take a little extra to setup.

### Better Refresh Mechanism

Having pull to refresh would have been better in my opinion. However, this is only available for `List` which forces 
undesirable UI. I could have tried to implement something on my own using `GeometryReader` or `ScrollViewReader` but
this would have required a lot of trial and error. For this exercise I am going with the manual option.
